### Overview of an E-commerce Application Flow

An e-commerce application involves several components that work together to enable users to browse, purchase, and manage products. Below is a high-level explanation of the core components, their relationships, and the overall flow.

---

### 1. **Core Components**

#### **Users**
- **Purpose**: Manage user accounts and authentication.
- **Data**:
  - User ID, name, email, password (hashed), address, phone number.
- **APIs**:
  - Create Account (Sign Up)
  - Login (JWT-based authentication)
  - Update Profile
  - Get User Details

#### **Products**
- **Purpose**: Manage product listings.
- **Data**:
  - Product ID, name, description, price, category, stock, images.
- **APIs**:
  - Create Product
  - Get Product List
  - Get Product by ID
  - Update Product
  - Delete Product
  - Search/Filter Products

#### **Cart**
- **Purpose**: Temporarily store products the user intends to purchase.
- **Data**:
  - Cart ID, User ID, list of product IDs with quantities.
- **APIs**:
  - Add Product to Cart
  - Remove Product from Cart
  - Update Product Quantity in Cart
  - View Cart
  - Clear Cart

#### **Orders**
- **Purpose**: Track purchases made by users.
- **Data**:
  - Order ID, User ID, list of products with quantities, total price, order status (pending, completed, canceled), payment details.
- **APIs**:
  - Create Order (triggered from cart)
  - Get Order Details
  - Update Order Status
  - Cancel Order

#### **Payments**
- **Purpose**: Process payments for orders.
- **Data**:
  - Payment ID, Order ID, payment status (pending, completed, failed).
- **APIs**:
  - Initiate Payment
  - Confirm Payment
  - Get Payment Status

#### **Inventory**
- **Purpose**: Manage stock for products.
- **Data**:
  - Product ID, available quantity.
- **APIs**:
  - Update Stock (reduce stock on order, increase on cancellation).

#### **Authentication**
- **Purpose**: Secure access to APIs using JWT.
- **Features**:
  - Sign Up
  - Login (returns JWT token)
  - Middleware to validate JWT for protected APIs.

#### **Messaging with Kafka**
- **Purpose**: Enable asynchronous processing for tasks like order updates, notifications, and analytics.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Notify users of order status (e.g., via email or SMS).
  - Synchronize inventory updates across microservices.
  - Log and process user activity for analytics.

### 2. **Flow and Relationships**

#### **User Registration and Authentication**
1. User signs up and provides details (username, email, password).
2. Password is hashed and stored securely in the database.
3. User logs in and receives a JWT token for secure access to APIs.
4. JWT middleware validates tokens for protected endpoints.

#### **Product Browsing**
1. Users fetch the product list (e.g., paginated with filters).
2. User selects a product to view details.
3. User adds the product to the cart.

#### **Cart Management**
1. User adds items to the cart with specific quantities.
2. Cart APIs allow users to update quantities, remove items, or view the cart.
3. User proceeds to checkout from the cart.

#### **Order Placement**
1. User initiates order placement from the cart.
2. Backend validates stock for each product.
3. Order is created, and stock is updated in the inventory.
4. Kafka produces a message for order confirmation, and consumers handle notifications and updates.

#### **Payment**
1. User selects a payment method and completes the transaction.
2. Backend updates the order status to `completed` upon successful payment or `failed` if the transaction fails.
3. Kafka messages trigger inventory updates and notifications.

#### **Inventory Updates**
1. On order creation, stock is reduced.
2. On order cancellation, stock is restored.
3. Kafka ensures synchronization between inventory and order services.

#### **Notifications**
1. Kafka consumers send notifications (e.g., order confirmations, status updates).
2. Notifications can be via email, SMS, or in-app alerts.

#### **Admin Features**
1. Admins can create, update, or delete products.
2. Admins can monitor and update order statuses.

### 3. **Component Interactions**

#### **Relationships**
1. **Users ↔ Orders**:
   - A user can place multiple orders; each order belongs to one user.
2. **Orders ↔ Products**:
   - An order contains one or more products with specific quantities.
3. **Cart ↔ Products**:
   - The cart temporarily holds products until the order is placed.
4. **Orders ↔ Payments**:
   - Every order is linked to a payment status.
5. **Inventory ↔ Products**:
   - Inventory tracks available stock for each product.
6. **Kafka ↔ All**:
   - Kafka ensures asynchronous communication and decoupling between services.

### 4. **Features Covered**

- **CRUD Operations**: Users, Products, Orders, Cart.
- **Authentication**: JWT for secure API access.
- **Concurrency**: Kafka for handling asynchronous tasks.
- **Data Integrity**: Validations to ensure stock consistency.
- **Scalability**: Kafka-based messaging ensures the system can handle high loads.

By implementing an **E-commerce Inventory and Order System**, you will cover:
- CRUD operations.
- Authentication and middleware.
- Kafka producers and consumers for asynchronous workflows.
- Database integration and queries.
- Business logic for stock, orders, and payments.

This project is highly relevant for interviews as it showcases your understanding of backend architecture, concurrency, messaging systems, and scalable design.



Ecommerce Application

This project is a robust ecommerce backend system built in Golang. It features a Kafka-based event-driven architecture for asynchronous communication between microservices, ensuring high throughput and low latency. The application exposes RESTful APIs using Gorilla Mux with secure JWT-based authentication and supports complete CRUD operations for managing users, products, and orders. It leverages MySQL for data storage with advanced features such as DB transactions and row-level locking to prevent race conditions during order processing. Additionally, the system integrates a mock payment gateway with webhook handling, uses Goroutines and Channels for efficient concurrency, and implements requeue/dequeue mechanisms to ensure fault-tolerant event processing. Real-time notifications are sent via SMTP, Webhooks, and Slack, making it a comprehensive, scalable solution for modern ecommerce requirements.
