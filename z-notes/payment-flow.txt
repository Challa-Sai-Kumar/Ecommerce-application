### **Webhook Flow Between Payment Gateway and Server**

A **webhook** allows a payment gateway (or any external service) to notify your server about events, such as a payment's status change. Below is a simplified explanation of the flow:

### **Actors in the Flow**

1. **Payment Gateway (Webhook Provider):**
   The external service (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal) sends webhook notifications to your server when a payment event occurs (like `payment_success`, `payment_failed`, etc.).

2. **Your Server (Webhook Consumer):**
   The server listens for incoming webhook notifications from the payment gateway, verifies the authenticity of the request, and processes the event accordingly.

### **Flow Overview**

#### **1. Payment Initiation (Client -> Gateway)**
   - **Frontend:** The user initiates a payment from the frontend (e.g., by clicking "Pay Now").
   - **Backend:** Your server creates a payment request with the gateway (via its API). This request includes details like the amount, order ID, and callback URLs (e.g., success, failure, or webhook URL).
   - **Payment Gateway:** Provides a hosted payment page or token to redirect the user to complete the payment.

#### **2. Payment Completion (Client -> Gateway)**
   - The user completes the payment (e.g., by entering card details or using a wallet).
   - The gateway processes the payment and determines its success or failure.

#### **3. Webhook Notification (Gateway -> Server)**
   - After processing, the gateway sends a **webhook** notification to your server with the payment details and status.
   - The server verifies the webhook (e.g., using HMAC signatures) to ensure the request is legitimate.
   - If valid, the server updates the payment status in the database (e.g., marking the order as "Paid" or "Failed").

#### **4. Payment Status Update (Server -> Client)**
   - After processing the webhook, the server may notify the frontend about the updated payment status via WebSocket, polling, or email.

### **Sequence of Events**

1. **Frontend Initiates Payment:**
   - User clicks "Pay Now."
   - Your server sends a request to the payment gateway to create a payment.

2. **Redirect to Payment Gateway:**
   - User is redirected to the payment gateway's hosted payment page.
   - User completes the payment (success or failure).

3. **Payment Gateway Sends Webhook:**
   - Gateway sends a POST request to your server's webhook endpoint with the payment details (e.g., order ID, amount, status).
   - Your server verifies and processes this webhook.

4. **Server Updates the Order:**
   - If the webhook is valid:
     - Mark the order as `Paid` or `Failed`.
     - Deduct or restore stock.
     - Send confirmation to the user.

### **Example Flow**

1. **Payment Initiation (Client -> Server):**
   - **Client:** `POST /api/orders/123/pay`
   - **Server:** Calls payment gateway API with:
     - Amount: $50
     - Order ID: `123`
     - Webhook URL: `https://example.com/api/webhooks/payment`

2. **User Completes Payment (Client -> Gateway):**
   - Gateway redirects the user to a payment page to complete the payment.

3. **Webhook Notification (Gateway -> Server):**
   - **Gateway:** Sends `POST` request to `https://example.com/api/webhooks/payment` with:
     ```json
     {
       "order_id": "123",
       "status": "success",
       "transaction_id": "txn_789"
     }
     ```

4. **Server Processes Webhook:**
   - Verifies the signature.
   - Marks the order as `Paid`.
   - Updates stock levels.

5. **Server Notifies Frontend:**
   - User sees updated order status in their dashboard.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Webhook Provider:** The payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay, PayPal) that sends webhook notifications to your server.
- **Webhook Consumer:** Your server processes the webhook and updates the payment or order status.
- **Webhook URL:** An endpoint on your server where the gateway sends POST requests.
