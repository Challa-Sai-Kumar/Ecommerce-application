### **What Does "Signing the Token" Mean?**

Signing a token is the process of attaching a cryptographic signature to the JWT to ensure its integrity and authenticity. The signature allows the recipient to verify that:
1. The token was issued by a trusted source (e.g., your server).
2. The token's contents (header and payload) have not been tampered with.

### **The JWT Structure**

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is composed of three parts:
1. **Header**: Metadata about the token (e.g., signing algorithm).
   ```json
   { "alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT" }
   ```
2. **Payload (Claims)**: Contains user-related data or claims.
   ```json
   { "userId": 123, "exp": 1735689600 }
   ```
3. **Signature**: A cryptographic hash of the header and payload, signed with a secret or private key.

A JWT looks like this:
```
<base64url-encoded-header>.<base64url-encoded-payload>.<signature>
```

### **Flow of Creating a JWT**

#### **1. Create the Header**
- Specify the algorithm used to sign the token (e.g., HS256 for HMAC-SHA256).
- Specify the type of the token (JWT).

Example:
```json
{ "alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT" }
```

#### **2. Create the Payload (Claims)**
- Include relevant data about the user or session (e.g., `userId`, `email`).
- Add optional claims like:
  - `iat` (Issued At): The time the token was created.
  - `exp` (Expiration): The time the token expires.
  - `sub` (Subject): The user identifier.

Example:
```json
{ "userId": 123, "exp": 1735689600 }
```

#### **3. Encode Header and Payload**
- Convert the header and payload to JSON.
- Base64URL-encode both the header and the payload.

Encoded Example:
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEyMywiZXhwIjoxNzM1Njg5NjAwfQ
```

#### **4. Create the Signature**
- Combine the encoded header and payload:
  ```
  <header>.<payload>
  ```
- Hash the combination using:
  - The signing algorithm (e.g., HMAC-SHA256).
  - A secret key (known only to the server).
- The result is the **signature**, which ensures integrity.

Example:
```
HMAC-SHA256(header.payload, secret-key)
```

#### **5. Concatenate Everything**
- Combine the encoded header, payload, and signature to form the final JWT:
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOjEyMywiZXhwIjoxNzM1Njg5NjAwfQ.signature
```

### **Flow of Validating a JWT**

#### **1. Extract the JWT**
- When a user sends a request, the JWT is typically included in the `Authorization` header as:
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ```

#### **2. Split the JWT**
- Separate the token into its three parts:
  ```
  <header>.<payload>.<signature>
  ```

#### **3. Verify the Signature**
- Recompute the signature using the header and payload from the token, along with the secret key.
- Compare the recomputed signature with the signature in the token:
  - If they match, the token is valid and untampered.
  - If they don’t match, the token is invalid or has been tampered with.

#### **4. Validate the Claims**
- Decode the payload and verify its claims:
  - Check the expiration time (`exp`):
    - Ensure the token hasn’t expired.
  - Validate any other claims (e.g., user roles, permissions).
  - Reject tokens that fail claim validation.

#### **5. Allow or Reject the Request**
- If the token is valid and claims are satisfied, allow access to the protected resource.
- If the token is invalid or expired, reject the request.

### **Key Concepts of JWT Signing and Validation**

1. **Secret Key**:
   - A shared secret key (e.g., for HMAC) or a private key (e.g., for RSA) is used to sign the token.
   - Only the server knows the key, ensuring that no one else can forge a valid token.

2. **Integrity and Authenticity**:
   - The signature guarantees that the header and payload haven’t been altered.
   - It also verifies that the token was issued by the server holding the secret key.

3. **Statelessness**:
   - JWTs are self-contained. Once issued, the server doesn’t need to store session data for each user.
   - The token itself carries all the necessary information.

### **Advantages of JWT**

1. **Scalability**: Stateless nature makes it suitable for distributed systems.
2. **Security**: Cryptographic signatures ensure the token's integrity and authenticity.
3. **Flexibility**: Can include any claims or data, making it versatile.

---

### **Summary**

- **Signing**: Combines the header and payload, hashes them with a secret key, and generates a cryptographic signature.
- **Validation**: Ensures the signature matches and verifies claims like expiration time.
- **Flow**: 
  1. Client sends credentials → Server generates JWT.
  2. Client sends JWT in requests → Server validates JWT.
  3. If valid, server allows access.
